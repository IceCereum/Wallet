IceCereum is a private cryptocurrency created by IceCereal for the absolute heck
of it. Over a span of three days, the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency was
made that conforms most of what you would expect to see in an proper
crytpocurrency. By design and for practical purposes, there is only one miner.
Although this seems like a very scuffed cryptocurrency, since it has no fiat
value you can put trust in the creator that they wont try to scam you into
stealing your IceCereums. At its heart, IceCereum is a cryptocurrency with
liberties taken while writing the code. But do not be mistaken, it is a proper
blockchain that runs on the interwebs.

To create a wallet, type the command "wallet create <wallet_name>". Give your
wallet a name that you will easily recognise. You will be shown 12 words which
will never be shown again. In the event you lost your wallet file, these 12
words will help you restore your wallet. NEVER SHARE these 12 words with anyone.
Standard procedures involve you writing these 12 words down on a piece of paper
and air-gapping that piece of paper. In the event you lose both your wallet
file AND your 12 words, your wallet is lost forever and there is nothing that
can be done about that. You can also do "wallet list" to get a list of your
wallets.

> Example: wallet create icy

When your wallet file is being created, you will be asked to enter a password to
encrypt it. Do not use your standard password because this code does not
implement any security measures against Side Channel Attacks, KeyLoggers or any
sort of Hacks on your RAM, Cache or Storage Devices. You will have to remember
this password in order to sign messages that authenticate your transaction /
transfer of funds. Failure to remember the password is not an issue. You can
always restore your wallet provided you have the 12 words written down
somewhere by typing "wallet restore <wallet_name>". If you are in this
situation, type "help wallet" to proceed from there.

> Example: wallet restore icy

The generated directory contains all the data required by the program including
a file which is an encrypted form of your wallet. Do NOT decrypt it on your own
or share that file to anyone. Once you verify that the folder exists in the same
folder as this CLI program (which it should be by default), you need to load
your wallet. Type: "wallet load <wallet_name>", where <wallet_name> is the name
of the wallet you entered while creating it.

> Example: wallet load icy

Provided you have enough funds, you can transfer them to an address you want to
by using the "transfer" command. You can do this in two ways:
In one command like: "transfer -to <to_address> -a <amount> -msg <message>";

> Example: transfer -to 0x5f808b8001693e23c62ad876e690d399937ea815 -a 15.5 -msg
> 'Received one diamond from IceCereal'

Or you could do it interactively by just typing "transfer" and filling in the
prompts the program asks you.

Now, it's not really easy remembering the addresses of your friends, so a neat
little option you have is the ability to create nicks by typing "nick create
<nick_name> <address>". This way, you can just do:

> Example: nick create IceCereal 0x5f808b8001693e23c62ad876e690d399937ea815
> Example: transfer -to IceCereal -a 15.5 -msg '...'

You can also do "nick list" to get a list of all the nicks you've stored and
"nick delete" to delete a nick.
